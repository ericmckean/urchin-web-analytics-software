The E-commerce section contains the following reports:

## Commerce Tracking ##
  * **Revenue & Transactions:** Revenue is determined by the number of purchases and the average purchase value. Some important steps you can take to maximise revenue are:
    1. Purchase targeted advertising and write effective ads (see the Traffic Sources reports)
    1. Make sure that your landing pages show the information, services or products that you promise in your ads (review the Content reports to help minimise bounce rates)
    1. Simplify your conversion funnels so that fewer would-be customers abandon the checkout process (review the Goals reports)
  * **Conversion Rate Graph:** This report shows the rate at which visits to your site result in purchases. Tracking conversion rates over time is an effective way of determining whether your marketing and website are becoming more or less efficient at turning visitors into customers. Note that conversion rates are most useful as company-specific benchmarks against which to assess marketing and site effectiveness because conversion rates vary considerably across businesses (even within the same industry)
  * **Average Order Value:** Tracking changes to the average order value over time is important to catalog sites that may change and shift which products and services they are actively marketing. Many E-commerce sites monitor this metric to see if cross promotions are working. This is an important metric that works its way into many higher-level executive and shareholder reports.
  * **Transaction List:** Transaction List is a list of all transactions on your site, useful for auditing your transactions.

## Loyalty & Latency ##

  * **New vs Returning:** This report shows you comparison of new visitors to returning visitors.
  * **Time to Transaction:** How long does it take before visitors make a transaction? Understanding your sales cycle is important to the overall success of your site. This report helps you understand how long it takes to convert your visitors into customers and, by extension, the kind of content you need to create in order to reach your prospects.
  * **Visits to Transaction:** How many visits does it take for visitors to transact? Understanding your sales cycle is important to the overall success of your site.

## Revenue Sources ##

  * **Organisations:** This report aggregates revenue according to the companies and ISPs that host your visitors.
  * **User-defined:** This report aggregates revenue based upon an arbitrary segment variable that you define. For example, the value selected in a pull-down menu of a registration form can be tagged to the visitor and used to determine conversion and behavior metrics. This report compares how visitors who identified with each of the different groups you defined compare with respect to revenue, number of transactions, and average transaction value.
