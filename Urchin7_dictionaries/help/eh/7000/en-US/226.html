This report is useful for verifying the specific goal pages that were logged, since a goal may be defined as a collection of pages. <p>If, for example, you have defined a goal as a directory, each of the pages within that directory count towards the goal. In this case, this report would show each of those pages, the number of visits to the page, and the percentage of the total goal conversions that each page represents. <p>Click the  <img alt="Analysis Options Button" title="Analysis Options Button" src="/uicons/report/analysis_options.gif" border="0"> button on the far left of any entry to see metrics displayed over time.</body></html>
