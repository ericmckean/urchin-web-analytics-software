For each of your referral sources, this report compares the performance of ad versions (according to the utm_content tag you used to tag specific links) with respect to number of visits referred, pageviews per visit, conversion rates, and average visit value. <p>Click the plus next to any source to drill down and compare ad versions. <p>Click the  <img alt="Analysis Options Button" title="Analysis Options Button" src="/uicons/report/analysis_options.gif" border="0"> button at the far left of any entry to view the data over time, to view to-date lifetime value, or to cross-segment this data.<p>To compare two date ranges, select the "Compare to Past" option on the Calendar tab. <p>Each source is qualified by medium, in brackets. Each medium is either one of the mediums with which you tagged referral links or one of the following special cases: <ul><li>[organic] indicates visitors referred by an unpaid search engine listing. <li>[referral] indicates visitors referred by links which were not tagged with any campaign variables. <li>[(not set)] indicates visitors referred by links which were tagged with campaign variables but for which the medium variable was not set. <li>(direct)[(none)] indicates visitors who visited the site by typing the URL directly into the browser.</ul><p>Visits is the number of visits referred by the source and ad version within that source. P/Visit is pageviews divided by number of visits. G/Visit is number of goal conversions divided by number of visits. T/Visits is number of e-commerce transactions divided by number of visits. $/Visits is revenue (from e-commerce) or goal value divided by number of visits.</body></html>
