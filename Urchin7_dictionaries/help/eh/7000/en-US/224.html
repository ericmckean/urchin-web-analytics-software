This report lists the navigation paths to the selected goal (Select your goal from the pull down menu at upper left) and shows the number of conversions that each path represents. This report is different from the defined funnel reports in that it shows the different navigation paths that were used to reach a goal, rather than tracking entrances to and exits from funnels you have defined. Useful for sites that are heavily cross linked, this report allows you to gain insight into "required" content that visitors need to see before they are comfortable with converting. This information can be used to improve the overall navigation of the site. </body></html>
