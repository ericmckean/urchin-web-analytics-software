Select an option to enter a few descriptive words or phrases, or use your website's URL.<p>The Keyword Tool is a great way to find new keywords for your ad <a href='https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6304' target='_blank' style='color: blue;'>campaigns</a>. For example, if you run a budget hotel, the Keyword Tool can suggest related keywords like "hotel discounts" or "motels." Adding these alternate terms to your <a href='https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6298' target='_blank' style='color: blue;'>ad group</a> keyword lists can help you find new customers that you might otherwise have missed.<p>The Keyword Tool is especially helpful in three situations:<ul><li>When you first create a new ad group</li><li>When your current keywords are performing poorly and you need to find better options</li><li>When you have one keyword that really works well and want to find more like it</li></ul>Remember that the Keyword Tool works best with short keywords of one or two words in length. "Budget hotel" will get better results than "inexpensive place for lodging while on a trip." That's because if your keyword includes many words, the Keyword Tool may have a hard time determining the most important words and delivering the appropriate alternatives.<br><p>Want more keyword ideas?
