Definitions are as follows:<p><b>Impressions</b><br>The number of impressions is the number of times an ad is displayed on Google or on sites or products in the Google Network.<p><b>Clicks</b><br>A click (sometimes called a clickthrough) occurs when a user sees your ad and clicks on the title of your ad, leading them to your website.<p><b>Cost</b><br>Cost is the dollar amount you'll be billed for the clicks your ad received.<p><b>CTR</b><br>Click-through rate.  A keyword's CTR is a strong indicator of its relevance to the user and the overall success of the keyword. For example, a well targeted keyword that shows a similarly targeted ad is more likely to have a higher CTR than a general keyword with non-specific ad text. The more your keywords and ads relate to each other and to your business, the more likely a user is to click on your ad after searching on your keyword phrase.<p><b>CPC</b><br>Cost-per-click. The average amount you pay each time someone clicks your ad. Average CPC is determined by totaling the cost of all clicks and dividing it by the number of clicks received.<p>To compare two date ranges, select the "Compare to Past" option on the Calendar tab.</body></html>
