This report compares pages by HTML title tag, aggregating as a single page those pages which have the same HTML title. Pages are compared in terms of the number of visits, number of pageviews, the average time spent on the page(s), the percentage of time the page(s) is an exit page, and the $Index. The highest $Index indicate pages that were commonly visited prior to high-value conversions during the same visit. <p>Click the <img alt="Analysis Options Button" title="Analysis Options Button" src="/uicons/report/analysis_options.gif" border="0"> button to the far left of any entry to see any metric displayed over time.<p>To compare two date ranges, select the "Compare to Past" option on the Calendar tab.<p>Visits is the total number of visits in which the page was viewed. Pageviews is the number of times the page was viewed. Avg Time is the average amount of time that the page was viewed. %Exit is the percentage of time that the page was the exit page (the last page viewed during a visit). $Index is the total revenue earned (from subsequent e-commerce transactions or conversions to goals with valuations) divided by the number of visits for that page.   </body></html>
