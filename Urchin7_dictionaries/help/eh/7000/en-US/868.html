The keyword states below may apply to any keyword (except negative keywords).</li><ul><li><b>Disapproved:</b> Keywords are always subject to review by AdWords Specialists. If your keywords don't comply with Google's advertising policies, they will be marked as Disapproved. A disapproved keyword may not enter the ad auction and therefore won't trigger your ads.</li>  <li><b>Paused / Deleted:</b> You may choose to pause or delete a keyword at any time in <a href='https://adwords.google.com/' target='_blank' style='color:blue'>Google AdWords</a>. These keywords won't enter the ad auction and therefore won't trigger your ads. You can resume a paused keyword by clicking 'Unpause' on your ad group details page in <a href='https://adwords.google.com/' target='_blank' style='color:blue'>Google AdWords</a>. To recover a deleted keyword, re-add it to your ad group.</li>  <li><b>Active:</b> The keyword is not disapproved, paused, or deleted, and is eligible to enter the ad auction.</li></ul><p><b>Budget</b><br>Your daily budget is the amount that you're willing to spend on a specific AdWords campaign each day.<p><b>Quality</b><br>A Quality Score is calculated every time your keyword matches a search query -- that is, every time your keyword has the potential to trigger an ad. Quality Score is used in several different ways, including:<p><b>Impressions</b><br>The number of impressions is the number of times an ad is displayed on Google or on sites or products in the Google Network.<p><b>Clicks</b><br>A click (sometimes called a clickthrough) occurs when a user sees your ad and clicks on the title of your ad, leading them to your website.<p><b>Cost</b><br>Cost is the dollar amount you'll be billed for the clicks your ad received.<p><b>CTR</b><br>Click-through rate. CTR is the number of clicks your ad receives divided by the number of times your ad is shown (impressions) via Google search only.<p>A low CTR may point to poor keyword performance, indicating a need for ad or keyword optimization. Therefore, you can use CTR to gauge which ads and keywords aren't performing as well for you and then optimize them.<p>CTR is also used to determine your keyword's Quality Score. Higher CTR and Quality Score can lead to lower costs and higher ad position.<p><b>CPC</b><br>Cost-per-click.  The average amount you pay each time someone clicks your ad. Average CPC is determined by totaling the cost of all clicks and dividing it by the number of clicks received.<p>To compare two date ranges, select the "Compare to Past" option on the Calendar tab.</body></html>
