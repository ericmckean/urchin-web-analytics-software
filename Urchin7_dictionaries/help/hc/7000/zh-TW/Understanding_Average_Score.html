<p class="line867"><strong>Understanding Average Score</strong> <p class="line874">Some Urchin reports include the Average Score metric. Average Score is a way of determining which pages are most valuable. It is not useful by itself, rather it is a way of comparing pages and links on your site. Those pages with highest scores are those which were most visited by visitors who later during their visit converted to high value goals. <p class="line874">Average score for a page is calculated as follows: <p class="line874">Total Value of Conversions Subsequent to Page Visit / Total Number of Page Views <p class="line867"><strong>Example</strong> <p class="line874">Imagine ten visits to your site which result in one conversion for a total value of $100. Five visits take the following path: <p class="line862">Homepage --&gt; page A --&gt; Goal page with a value of $100. <p class="line874">The other five visits take the following path: <p class="line862">Homepage --&gt; page B --&gt; exit site <p class="line874">The average score of each page would be: <p class="line874">Average Score of homepage = 50 (= 5 subsequent conversions * $100 / 10 total page views) Average Score of page A = 100 (= 5 subsequent conversions * $100 / 5 total page views) Average Score of page B = 0 (because no goals were reached) <p class="line874">Average Score may be calculated from goals or e-commerce <p class="line874">Urchin calculates average score from both e-commerce and goal conversions. For e-commerce, the conversion value used to calculate average score is taken directly from transaction revenue. For goals, Urchin calculates average score using the values you assigned to your goals. </div><div id="pagebottom"></div>
