<p class="line867"><strong>Why do I see 'Other' in my reports?</strong> <p class="line874">Every record in the Urchin report resides in a fixed-size database. The files that comprise the database are rotated monthly. So, there is a limit to how many unique records can be listed in the database for every month. <p class="line874">If that limit is reached Urchin will create one last record called "other". The "other" record can turn up several reports. After the limit is reached, any additional unique records that are added to the report data are moved into the "Other" record. So, if 5 new pages are viewed when the database is full, the record called "other" will count 5 additional page views. <p class="line874">The limit for the database records can be increased. By default that limit is set to 100,000 records. That means that Urchin will record a total of 100,000 unique record items every month for every profile. That number can be increased if you have "Super Admin" access. If you do not have proper access, you will have to contact your Urchin Administrator and request that they make the necessary changes for you. <p class="line874">Increasing the DB Table Limit Globally: <ul><li>Click Configuration (top right of interface). </li><li>Click Settings (left navigation). </li><li>Click the DB Settings tab. </li><li>Use the drop down list arrow to increase the "DB Table Limit" to the desired value. </li><li>Click Update to save your changes.  </li></ul><p class="line874">Increasing the DB Table Limit for an existing Profile: <ul><li>Click Configuration (top right of interface). </li><li>Click the edit wrench for the Profile in question. </li><li>Click the Storage/DB tab. </li><li>Change the DB Table Limit value to the new desired record limit. Using 'Global Default' will match the Profile limit to that of the current Global setting as noted above.  </li><li>Click Update. </li></ul><p class="line874">Note: Keep in mind that this will increase the disk space useage as well as the time required to open various report views since the Urchin report interface will have to retrieve data from a larger database. </div><div id="pagebottom"></div>
