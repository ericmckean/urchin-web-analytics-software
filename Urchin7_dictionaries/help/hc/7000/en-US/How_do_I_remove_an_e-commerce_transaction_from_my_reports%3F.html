<p class="line867"><strong>How do I remove an e-commerce transaction from my reports?</strong> <p class="line862">To cancel an order or transaction, find the transaction in your records. Then, create and load a duplicate receipt (<tt class="backtick">__</tt>utmSetTrans) page which contains a negative transaction total that cancels out the original transaction. For example, if the the original transaction total is 699 dollars, the duplicate entry should have -699 dollars as the transaction total. <p class="line874">In order to credit back part of a previous transaction, you must: <ul><li>use the same transaction id for the transaction and item form data that was used for the purchase. </li><li>provide a negative value for the Total field in the the transaction form data </li><li><p class="line862">provide a <strong>positive</strong> value for the per unit price and a <strong>negative</strong> value for the quantity in the item form data </li><li>If any tax or shipping charges are being credited back, provide negative values for these fields in the transaction form data </li></ul><p class="line874">If the negative revenue is for the entire previous transaction,  you'll see both the positive and negative entries in the transaction reports if you select a date range that contains either transaction by itself. However, if you select a date range that includes both transactions, the entries will cancel and the transaction drops out of the reports completely (because the revenue total for that transaction id is zero). The negative item quantity should result in the same effect in the products reports. <p class="line874">Cancelling orders which did not go through or which were disallowed for one reason or another ensures that your Urchin reports provide accurate information. </div><div id="pagebottom"></div>
