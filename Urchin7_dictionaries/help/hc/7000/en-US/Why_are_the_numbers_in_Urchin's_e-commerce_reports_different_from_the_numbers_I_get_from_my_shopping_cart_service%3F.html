<p class="line867"><strong>Why are the numbers in Urchin's e-commerce reports different from the numbers I get from my shopping cart service?</strong> <p class="line874">There are several reasons that your shopping cart may have different data than is reported in your Urchin reports. <p class="line874">Your shopping cart may be configured to report data in a different time zone than your Urchin reports. For example, your shopping cart may be configured to report on Eastern Standard Time, while your Urchin reports are configured to report on Pacific Standard Time. Under these circumstances, a transaction that occurred at 11PM PST on Monday will be recorded in your shopping cart as happening on 1AM on Tuesday. As a result, your daily reports will not be the same in your Urchin reports and your shopping cart. <p class="line874">Your reports may be off if you set up your Urchin E-commerce tracking in the middle of a certain day and are looking at your daily reports in your shopping cart. The transactions that happened before you implemented Urchin's tracking software will not appear in your Urchin Reports. <p class="line862">Finally, there is a possibility that you simply have not properly set up your Urchin e-commerce tracking. Please read <a href="How_do_I_track_e-commerce_transactions%253F.html">How do I track e-commerce transactions?</a> to make sure that you have implemented the code properly. <p class="line874">If none of the above possibilities apply to your situation and your reports still do not match, please contact your Urchin Software Authorized Consultant and let them know exactly what is wrong. Please specify whether the total number of transactions is wrong, if the purchased amounts is wrong or if you have noticed certain products failing to appear in one of your reports. </div><div id="pagebottom"></div>
