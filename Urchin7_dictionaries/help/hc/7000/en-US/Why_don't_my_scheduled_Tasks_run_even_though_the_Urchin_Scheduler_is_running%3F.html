<p class="line867"><strong>Why don't my scheduled Tasks run even though the Urchin Scheduler is running?</strong> <p class="line867"><strong>Description of Problem</strong> <p class="line874">Under certain circumstances, the Urchin Scheduler (urchind) may fail to run scheduled Tasks even though the Scheduler is running. Indications of this are: <ol type="1"><li><p class="line862">The Tasks show up as scheduled in the Configuration -&gt; Scheduler -&gt; Task Scheduler screen of the Urchin administration tool, and are rescheduled as expected; but the tasks never actually run </li><li>Clicking the "Run Now" button in the Profile Run/Schedule screen brings the expected popup progress window, but the progress bar just says "Error (0%)" and the task never completes. </li></ol><p class="line867"><strong>Cause</strong> <p class="line874">The usual reason for this is that the Urchin Scheduler was started from a directory that has either been removed, or the permissions were changed so that Urchin no longer has access to it. <p class="line874">As an example, it is very typical to unpack the Urchin installer into a temporary directory to do an installation or upgrade. During the install/upgrade process, the Urchin Scheduler is started with the current working directory being the temporary directory. If that directory is then later removed, the Urchin Scheduler will stop working properly. <p class="line867"><strong>Remedy</strong> <p class="line874">To ensure that the Urchin applications can start and run properly, be sure that you start the Urchin Scheduler from a permanent location where Urchin will always have proper access permissions. If you are having problems with the Scheduler, it is best to restart the Urchin services using the following procedure: <p class="line867"><strong>Windows Systems</strong> <ol type="1"><li><p class="line862">Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Urchin -&gt; Disable Urchin Services </li><li><p class="line862">Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Urchin -&gt; Enable Urchin Services </li></ol><p class="line867"><strong>UNIX-type Systems</strong> <ol type="1"><li>Start a command shell either as "root" or the user that Urchin runs as </li><li>Change direcotry to the location where Urchin is installed - e.g. "cd /usr/local/urchin" </li><li>Restart the Urchin services with "bin/urchinctl restart" </li></ol></div><div id="pagebottom"></div>
