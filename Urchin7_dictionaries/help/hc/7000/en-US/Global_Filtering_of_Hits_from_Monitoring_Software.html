<p class="line867"><strong>Global Filtering of Hits from Monitoring Software</strong> <p class="line867"><strong>Overview</strong> <p class="line874">Most Hosting environments provide some sort of monitoring of customer webservers in order to maintain Service Level Agreements (SLAs). As a side effect, however, the hits from this monitoring can really skew the Urchin reporting for the monitored web sites - artificially inflating session, pageview, hit and byte counts. <p class="line867"><strong>Recommendation</strong> <p class="line874">In Hosting environments that employ such monitoring, it is highly recommended that a standard/global Urchin filter is applied to each customer's configured Urchin profiles to strip out the hits generated by montoring software. This is easily done in an environment where a centralized Urchin installation (managed by the hosting company) provides reporting for each customer's website(s). In dedicated/colocation environments where the customers themselves maintain an instance of Urchin on their server(s), the Hosting company should provide a sample filter that is appropriate for the monitoring being used. <p class="line874">To aid in the implementation of Urchin filtering, the Host and the customer should work together to create a specific page on the customer website that only the monitoring software utilizes, e.g. something like: <pre>     http://www.customerdomain.com/healthpage.html
</pre><p class="line874">Examples <p class="line874">Example 1: Filter out the IP address for the monitoring system <pre>      Filter Type: Exclude
      Filter Field: IP
      Filter Spec: 172\.16\.1\.1
</pre><ul><li style="list-style-type:none">This will strip any hits with the IP address 172.16.1.1 out of the webserver log as Urchin is processing it.  </li></ul><p class="line874">Example 2: Filter out specific page that the monitoring system hits <pre>      Filter Type: Exclude
      Filter Field: REQUEST
      Filter Spec: ^/healthpage.html
</pre><ul><li style="list-style-type:none">This will strip any hits with a request for /healthpage.html out of the webserver log as Urchin is processing it.  </li></ul><p class="line874">Considerations <ol type="1"><li>It may be desirable to create additional, non-filtered Profiles for the customers so they can see the actual traffic load (including the filtering) on the webserver(s). </li><li>The Hosting company may want to provide a Profile that provides reporting exclusively for the monitoring hits - e.g. it filters in only hits from the monitoring software. This profile could be used to show that the proper monitoring is being done and that SLAs are being met. </li></ol></div><div id="pagebottom"></div>
