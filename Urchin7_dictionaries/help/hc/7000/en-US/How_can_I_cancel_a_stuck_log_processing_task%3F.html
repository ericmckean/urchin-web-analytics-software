<p class="line867"><strong>How can I cancel a stuck log processing task?</strong> <p class="line867"><strong>Scenario 1: Task is taking too much time</strong> <p class="line874">If you want to cancel a task because it taking too much time, you'll need to kill the log processing engine. You can do this on Unix by killing the "urchin" process and on Windows using the Process Manager. <p class="line874">NOTE: Do not simply delete the profile and recreate it. Although it no longer appears on the scheduler page, the task will remain stuck and the scheduler will remain blocked. <p class="line867"><strong>Scenario 2: System has crashed/rebooted unexpectedly</strong> <p class="line874">In this scenario, the task was running satisfactorily but the system was rebooted or crashed without the proper exit signals to the log processing engine and scheduler. This leaves the database entries for tasks in an inconsistent state. When the system boots up, the scheduler and log processing engine will not pick up that profile and the admin interface will erroneously show that the profile is running. If you attempt to schedule the same profile again, you'll get a message saying that the task is already queued/running.  <p class="line874">In this case, the solution is to simply wait for 30 minutes. The master scheduler removes from the database all tasks that have not been updated in last the 30 minutes. Once the task has been removed, the admin schedule page will show the task status as "Error" and you'll be able to reschedule the profile. </div><div id="pagebottom"></div>
