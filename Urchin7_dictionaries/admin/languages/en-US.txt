184	<nobr><span class=title1><b>Global Settings: Autoupdate (Ref. #A-2704)</b></span></nobr><p><b>Versions<br></b>Autoupdate functionality allows to independently update following Urchin components:<ul><li>Urchin - contains all components but Geo Databases (approximately 50MB)</li><li>Help Articles - contains the Embedded Help and the Help Center articles (approximately 5MB per each language)</li><li>Geo Databases - contains all geo databases (approximately 200MB)</li></ul>Available Actions:<ul><li>check now - check for updates</li><li>view changelist - view the changelist of a new version</li><li>schedule download now - initiate the download of a new version</li><li>cancel - cancel the download</li><li>install now - initiate the installation process</li><li>view error log - view errors</li></ul></p><p><b>Schedule Update<br></b>Use these controls to modify if and when the components are updated. By default, the components are updated daily. If enabled, each day at the configured time, Urchin will automatically download updates. Note that the Geo Database updates are relatively large (approximately 200MB), so the download can have an impact on network bandwidth.</p><p><b>HTTP Proxy Settings (optional)<br></b>If outbound access to the Google download server hosting the geodata updates requires the use of a proxy, use these fields to specify the proxy server name and port, and username and password.</p><p><b>Update Settings<br></b>If enabled, Help Articles or Geo Databases will be updated according to the configured time in a silent mode without any user intrusion.</p>
185	<nobr><span class=title1><b>Profiles: Storage/DB (Ref. #A-2108)</b></span></nobr><br>This screen allows you to set data management options.  For fault tolerant operations, Urchin provides automatic backup and recovery options.  Use these options to ensure safe operation.  Urchin also provides an automatic archiving option, which can automatically compress old data. <p><b>DB Memory Usage</b><br>Under normal operation, Urchin uses a cache system to limit how much RAM is used by the processing engine.  There can be a performance increase to run the entire process in memory, but this should only be used on dedicated Urchin systems and be aware that the process may consume all available RAM on the system.  For most operations, leave this set to “Limit with Cache System”.<p><b>DB Table Limit</b><br>To keep the size of data and the relating performance of Urchin on large sites in check, this setting will limit any one table in the Urchin Databases to the number of records listed.  The default option is appropriate for most installations.  Within a given month, if this limit is reached, additional entries will be lumped under an entry called ‘Other’. For optimal performace, use value less than or equal to 100,000. <p><b>Keep Raw Tracking Data</b><br>This option when turned off will delete raw visitor and session information after processing.  This can significantly improve log processing performance and reduce the amount of data stored for large sites.  Once raw session data is deleted, any additional hits for that session will be treated as a new session, which can cause a small edge effect in the reporting.  <p><b>Log Tracking</b><br>Urchin is equipped with a ‘smart’ log tracking facility that allows it to determine whether or not it has already processed a given log file. This enables you to rotate logs whenever it is convenient, rather than according to a rigid schedule. It also allows you to merely point Urchin at a directory of log files without concern for whether some have already been processed. IMPORTANT NOTE: if Urchin is not actually resident on the system that stores the log files, it will completely copy all logs to the local Urchin system before determining whether the logs have already been processed. This will cause significant network overhead if there are large log files being analyzed.<p><b>Auto Rollback DB</b><br>When enabled this option can automatically repair data if processing was stopped or killed part way through.  Urchin will automatically detect this condition and roll back the data to the most recent backup (assuming there is one) before continuing.<p><b>Create Backups</b><br>This option enables the automatic creation of backups after processing.  Backups are compressed for compact storage.<p><b>Clean Backups</b><br> This option enables the automatic clean-up of old backups according to the number of desired backups to keep in the next option.  If enabled, Urchin will automatically delete old backups keeping storage in check.  <p><b>Number of Backups to Keep</b><br> This option specified how many backups per month to keep for the clean function mentioned above.<p><b>Archive DB</b><br> This option enables the auto archiving of old monthly data.  Old data is automatically compressed into a single archive, backups are removed, and the data is locked.  Reporting can still view archived data, but no more hits may be processed for the months that are archived.<p><b>Archive DB After</b><br>This option specifies how many months old the data is before auto-archiving is started.<p><b>Delete ALL Data for Profile</b><br>Use this action to permanently delete ALL data for this Profile including ALL backups and archives.  You will need to reprocess all log files for this Profile.  <b>Warning</b>: Verify that you have all log files before deleting this data.

191	Welcome to the Urchin Setup Wizard! <p>The Setup Wizard is a simplified series of configuration steps that will get you up and running in no time.  If you want to change things later, you‘ll have full access to all settings through the Configuration section of the administrative interface.<p>  Please click Continue to get started!
192	<nobr><span class=title1><b>Scheduler: Task Progress (Ref. #A-2664)</b></span></nobr><br>This screen shows the progress of the task that is currently running. It also provides controls to cancel the running task. A Progress Bar is displayed at the top of the window and shows the approximate percent of processing that is complete. Use the ‘Cancel Task’ button to stop the running task and to roll back the Profile. A clickable link to the reporting for the Profile is provided above the progress bar. The runtime output from the log processing engine is displayed in the Task Process Detail window. <p>Note: If a large remote Log File is being processed, a significant amount of time may be required to copy data, during which the progress bar will not move. Once the file has been copied to the computer running Urchin, the progress bar should update more or less continuously.
193	<nobr><span class=title1><b>Scheduler: History Detail (Ref. #A-2563)</b></span></nobr><br>The purpose of this screen is to show the detail of the execution of a Task, generally for debugging or performance evaluation purposes. If there has been an error, this screen will give some indication of a remedy. <p><b>Common Issues</b><br>Common problems include ‘log file not found’ errors, which can usually be remedied easily by correcting a path or filename. If FTP is being used to move log files across the network, be sure the username and password are correct by logging in to the server with a dedicated FTP program. If the ‘data proc’ (data processing) time is only a small fraction of the total Run Time, there is probably an issue with log file copying over the network, and you may wish to consider installing Urchin directly on the server.

For more information on filtering, please refer to the manual or our online Documentation Center.<p><b>Examples</b><br>When adding a new filter, a list of example filters is provided for convenience.  Selecting an example filter will auto-populate the settings for the filter, which should then be edited for specifics.  This can be an easy way to see how the settings are created for various common filters.<p><b>Optional Account</b> (Datacenter mode only)<br>For new filters, allows you to select the Account that the filter should be associated with. For existing filters, the name of the Account that the filter belongs to is displayed.<p><b>Filter Name</b><br>This required field is an arbitrary name that is used for convenience when referencing this Filter. Enter something that will be unique for this Filter.<p><b>Filter Type</b><br>Depending on what you want the Filter to do, select one of the Filter types: <li><b>Exclude Pattern</b>: This type of filter will <i>only</i> exclude log file lines (hits) that match the Filter Pattern. The lines that do match will be ignored completely, so bear in mind that a Filter that excludes, for example, Netscape, will cause Urchin to exclude all other information in that log line, such as visitor, path, referral, and domain information.  <li><b>Include Pattern</b>: This type of filter will <i>only</i> include log file lines (hits) that match the Filter Pattern -- all others will be ignored. As in the above example, any hits that are ignored are completely unavailable to the Urchin system from a reporting standpoint.  <li><b>Search & Replace</b>: This is a simple filter that can be used to search for a pattern within a field and replace the found pattern with an alternate form.  If the pattern occurs more than once in the field, then only the last occurrence is replaced.  The ‘^’ character can be used to match at the beginning of the field, and the ‘$’ can be used to tie the match to the end of the field. <li><b>Lookup Table</b>:Selecting this filter allows you to select a lookup table which may be used to map codes to human intelligible labels. A corresponding lookup table file must be created first and installed in the ‘lib/custom/lookuptables’ directory of the Urchin distribution (internal) or located on the local file system, NFS or UNC (Windows only) share. FTP/HTTP sources are not supported.<li><b>Advanced</b>: This type of filter allows you to build a field from one or two other fields.  The filtering engine will apply the expressions in the two Extract fields to the specified fields and then construct a field using the Constructor expression.  The technique follows POSIX regular expression usage. <p><b>Filter Field</b><br>Use the pulldown menu to select which field in the Log Source the filter should apply to.  Fields labeled ‘RAW’ represent the actual contents of the log file with no processing.  Fields labeled ‘AUTO’ are auto-calculated fields that are determined based on RAW and other AUTO fields.  For a complete list of what all the fields are used for, see the filtering section of the online Documentation Center. <p><b>Filter Pattern</b><br>Set this to the pattern that the filter should match.  The pattern can use wildcards that are defined by the POSIX regular expression standard.<p><b>Search String</b><br>For Search & Replace filters, the Search String is used as the pattern to match in the field.<p><b>Replace String</b><br>For Search & Replace filters, the Replace String is used as the replacement for the Search String.<p><b>Table Name</b> (Lookup Table Only)<br>This field, visible when you select Lookup Table as the filter type, allows you to select an internal lookup table which maps codes to human intelligible names. The phone models table maps abbreviated phone platform identifiers to the model and manufacturer names for phone based web browsers. You may create your own lookup tables to map codes to campaigns (for the Campaign Tracking Module) or to map variables in a URL to page names. Any file that you create with a file extension of .lt in the ‘lib/custom/lookuptables’ directory of the Urchin distribution will appear in the internal tables dropdown list.<p><b>File Name</b> (External Lookup Table Only)<br>This field, visible when you select Lookup Table as the filter type, allows you to select an external lookup table file, which maps codes to human intelligible names. You may create your own lookup tables to map codes to campaigns (for the Campaign Tracking Module) or to map variables in a URL to page names.<p><b>Username/Password</b> (Windows, External Lookup Table Only)<br>These fields are used to specify the user credentials to the UNC share on which the external lookup table is located.<p><b>Controls</b><br>Click the Finish button (for a new filter) or the Update button (for an existing filter) to save your changes.

The default location is in the data/reports/<i>account_name</i> directory within the Urchin distribution.  The entire data directory can be moved on a system-wide basis by editing the urchin.conf file in the etc directory.  A Browse button is provided for convenience.<p><b>Run History Location</b><br>This optional setting specifies the directory path for storing the runtime history data for all the Profiles that belong to this Account. The default location is in the data/history/<i>account_name</i> directory within the Urchin distribution.  A Browse button is provided for convenience.<p><b>Directory Browsing Location</b><br>This optional setting is provided as a security measure when giving an Account admin access to create Profiles.  A directory path entered into this field will limit the Account admin‘s ability to browse for log files to that directory.  By default there is no browsing restriction.  This can be changed on a system-wide basis by modifying the urchin.conf file in the etc directory. A Browse button is provided for convenience.
539	<nobr><span class=title1><b>Settings: Global Settings (Ref. #A-2701)</b></span></nobr><br>This screen allows you to set the access settings for this Urchin installation. These settings will vary depending on whether you are installing Urchin on a server or on a desktop computer.<p><b>Web-based Report Access</b><br>To allow Users to be able to log-in and view reports remotely using a web browser, select ‘on’.  To only be able to view reports while sitting at the console of the system that Urchin is installed on, select ‘off’.<p><b>Web-based Administration</b><br>To allow the ‘admin’ user to log-in and modify configuration remotely using a web browser, select ‘on’.  To only be able to modify configuration while sitting at the console of the system that Urchin is installed on, select ‘off’.<p>In general, both of the settings are set to ‘on’ for server installations, and at least web-based administration is turned ‘off’ for desktop operation.<p>Note that it can be overridden by ALLOW_AUTO_LOGIN option in the etc/session.conf file.<p><b>Direct Report Linking</b><br>IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE: Enabling this feature turns off session-based security controls and allows you to create links directly to reports.  This can be useful for systems that are already password or network protected.  Once this feature is enabled, you can link directly to reports using the format:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(baseurl)/report.cgi?profile=(profilename)&user=(username)<p>where (baseurl) is everything before session.cgi in the current URL, (profilename) is the URI-escaped name of the profile, and (username) is a user that has access to the report.  The user= setting is optional and controls the language and localization preferences; if not specified the admin user is assumed.  See the .report.conf file in the htdocs directory of the Urchin distribution for additional configuration and access control options.<p><b>Server Port Number</b><br>This option specifies which port number to run the Urchin web service on.  After changing this option, you will need to restart the Urchin services using the “urchinctl” application in the bin directory of the product.  See installation documentation for more details.  By default, Urchin runs on port 9999, although this can be changed during installation.<p><b>Controls</b><br>Be sure to click the Update button to save your changes. The Tabs at the top of the screen allow access to other settings.
540	<nobr><span class=title1><b>Settings: Server Settings (Ref. #A-2702)</b></span></nobr><br>This screen allows you to change the server port that is used by the Urchin administration and report generation systems. <p><b>Server Port Number</b><br>The web-based administration and report viewing runs on the specified Port of the server that Urchin is installed on. By default, this is set to port 9999. Important note: do not change this number to a port in use by another service, such as standard HTTP (port 80), or sendmail (port 25). We recommend that you discuss this issue with your system administrator if you plan to change the port from 9999.  After changing this value, you will need to restart the Urchin Services to have the changes take effect. The two Urchin Services are the Scheduler (‘urchind’), and the Server (‘urchinwebd’).  To restart these services on Windows platforms, use Disable and Enable options in the Start->Programs->Urchin menu.  On UNIX-type platforms, run ‘bin/urchinctl restart’ in the Urchin directory.

543	<nobr><span class=title1><b>Process Settings: DNS Settings (Ref. #A-2301)</b></span></nobr><br>This screen allows you to configure the DNS Lookup functionality of Urchin which translates IP addresses to domain names (i.e. 63.212.171.4 -> urchin.com).  This allows Urchin to report on domain names, networks and countries.  To configure DNS you will need the IP address of a local name server.  Ask your administrator for details.<p><b>DNS Lookup</b><br>Select the ‘on’ button to enable DNS Lookups.<p><b>Resolver IP</b><br>Enter the IP address of a local DNS name server that is ok for Urchin to query for converting IPs to domain names.<p><b>DNS Loops</b><br>This setting controls how many attempts at resolution Urchin will make before giving up.  The default setting of 5 is good for most installations.<p><b>Resolution Target</b><br>Once Urchin reaches the Resolution Target, it will stop processing DNS.  Having this setting at the default of 80% is a good balance between processing speed and resolution.  Increasing this number may slow down operation.<p><b>Controls</b><br>Click the Update button to save your changes. The Tabs at the top of the screen allow access to other settings.
544	<nobr><span class=title1><b>Global Settings: DB Settings (Ref. #A-2302)</b></span></nobr><br>This screen allows you to set some basic parameters for controlling performance vs. resource usage. The default values are generally the best compromise of speed vs. processor and disk usage, but if you need to either speed up Urchin or lessen its impact on the computer it is running on, adjust these settings accordingly. <p><b>DB Table Limit</b><br>To keep the size of Urchin‘s database on large sites in check, use this setting to limit any one table to the number of records listed.  The default option is appropriate for most installations.  Within a given month, if this limit is reached, additional entries will be lumped under an entry called ‘Other’. So, if your reports are showing high proportion of Other entries, consider increasing this setting. For optimal performace, use value less than or equal to 100,000<p><b>Memory Usage Target</b><br>This setting provides a guide to the Urchin process as to how much memory to use during runtime.  For larger sites, a larger memory footprint can increase performance as the system does less disk caching.  The default setting is conservative, and increasing the target to at least 512MB is recommended on systems with sufficient physical memory.<p><b>Geo Detail</b><br><p><b>Geo Information</b><br>This setting controls which geo information will be included in the profile reports. Selecting additional options increases the memory footprint of the Log Processing Engine (approx. 350 MB for Networks, 100 MB for Domains and 20-150 MB for Geo Locations, depending upon the geo-database you choose). Urchin ships with several geo-databases, which vary in the level of country/region detail provided. Select the geo-database that best fits your needs from the drop-down menu.<p><b>Geo Database</b><br>Urchin ships with several geo-databases, each providing different levels of geo locations information:<br>- World (contains detailed Country/Region/City information for the entire World)<br>- World Lightweight (contains only Country-level information for the entire World)<br>- Regional databases like United States, European Union and Japan, which contain detailed information for corresponding regions and country level information for the rest of the World). <br><br>Geo-database settings can be defined globally or at the profile level.<p><b>Controls</b><br>Click the Update button to save your changes. The Tabs at the top of the screen allow access to other settings.
545	<nobr><span class=title1><b>Process Settings: Memory Usage (Ref. #A-2303)</b></span></nobr><br>This screen allows you to adjust the approximate memory usage of the Urchin log processing engine. Unless you have very large log files, it is recommended that the default setting be used.  For large logs, the speed of Urchin can be increased by increasing the memory usage to take advantage of available resources.  Setting the memory too high may cause failures in memory allocation or slow downs due to swapping.<p><b>Memory Usage Target</b><br>Use the pulldown menu to select how much memory Urchin will use while processing.  Urchin may use slightly more or less than the selected number depending on the data.  The Customize option should only be used in specialized cases by experienced Urchin administrators.<p><b>Customized Memory Usage Settings</b><br>When the custom memory setting is chosen, additional options will appear to allow for setting each of the primary Urchin buffers manually.  Settings these values in megabytes will change the size of the buffering and thus the overall performance.  Adjusting these values is not recommended.<p><b>Controls</b><br>Click the Update button to save your changes. The Tabs at the top of the screen allow access to other settings.

569	<nobr><span class=title1><b>Profiles: Reporting (Ref. #A-2106)</b></span></nobr><br>The Reporting Settings screen allows you to control several important processing features of Urchin including the identification of certain filters and proxy settings.<p><b>Website URL</b><br>This setting is used to create reference links back to your actual website.  This should be the complete domain name of the site, including the http://.  <p><b>Site Domains</b> (super-admin only)<br>This setting should list all possible domains for your website, with and without the “www”.  This field is used to determine if a Referral is external to your site.  Use commas to separate each domain entry.  <p><b>Default Page</b><br> This should be set to whatever the default (or index) page is in this site‘s directories. Usually, this will be “index.html”, but on Windows IIS servers, it is often “Default.htm” or “index.htm”. This information allows Urchin to reconcile log entries such as “http://www.urchin.com/” and “http://www.urchin.com/index.html”, which are in fact the same page. Without the Default Page information entered correctly, these would be reported as two distinct pages. Only a single default page should be specified. <p><b>Proxy Settings</b> (super-admin only)<br>Some installations may need proxy settings in order to show the homepage overlay reports.  Since the overlay queries are initiated from the Urchin system, it is possible that the firewall settings may not allow external communication.  If this is true, then you may use a proxy to allow these types of queries.  The proxy server should be the hostname of the server.  The proxy port should be the port number to communicate with the proxy.  The proxy username and password fields can also provide additional security if a username and password is needed to access the proxy.  Leave all these fields blank unless you get an error trying to use the overlay feature.  If so, contact your network administrator for settings.<p><b>Parallel Log Processing</b> (super-admin only)<br>If you have many large load balanced logs, it may be a performance boost to run them in parallel.  This depends on many factors including the size of the data and IO performance of the machine.  Especially if hits from a single user session can exist in multiple logs, then try enabling this setting for increased performance.  <p><b>Time Offset</b> (super-admin only)<br>This setting determines in what time zone Urchin reports the data.  Since all hits contain GMT reference, Urchin can report in any time zone.  The ‘Local Time’ option will record data according to the time zone configured on the server Urchin is running on.  To use a different setting, select the offset from GMT.  <p><b>Organic Keywords Match</b> (super-admin only)<br>This setting controls how Urchin detects search engines and keywords for those reports.  Using this list (comma-separated), Urchin will look for parameters in referring site queries that match.  Urchin then captures the value of the parameter as the keywords or search term used in the referral.  Use this list to add entries in order to capture search terms that may not be automatically included.  The default list works for most search engines.<p><b>Pageview Mimes Match</b> (super-admin only)<br> This comma-separated list controls which file extensions are treated as pageviews. The logic can be set to either include or exclude certain extensions. The default list works for most sites.<p><b>Page Parameters Match</b><br>This setting controls which parameters Urchin will capture or avoid capturing in the Parameters Report.  Parameters come from the query part of the requested URL, and may contain internal search terms or other dynamic content.  Urchin will automatically capture these name value pairs and report on them in the Parameters Report.  This comma-separated list allows you to exclude or include certain parameters.  For example, a site with millions of random session IDs may wish to exclude the SID variable from this report in order to save storage resources.<p><b>Downloads Match</b> (super-admin only)<br> This comma-separated list controls which file extensions are treated as downloaded files in the Downloads report.  Edit the list as necessary to include file extensions used for downloads.<p><b>Geo Detail</b><br><p><b>Geo Information</b><br>This setting controls which geo information will be included in the profile reports. Selecting additional options increases the memory footprint of the Log Processing Engine (approx. 350 MB for Networks, 100 MB for Domains and 20-150 MB for Geo Locations, depending upon the geo-database you choose). Urchin ships with several geo-databases, which vary in the level of country/region detail provided. Select the geo-database that best fits your needs from the drop-down menu.<p><b>Geo Database</b><br>Urchin ships with several geo-databases, each providing different levels of geo locations information:<br>- World (contains detailed Country/Region/City information for the entire World)<br>- World Lightweight (contains only Country-level information for the entire World)<br>- Regional databases like United States, European Union and Japan, which contain detailed information for corresponding regions and country level information for the rest of the World).<br> <p><b>Character Encoding</b><br>If the logs you will be processing contain data that is not encoded in UTF-8, choose the correct encoding format for the data. Native Japanese and Latin 1 formats are supported.  <p><b>Currency and Precision</b><br>For e-commerce sites, use the Currency and Precision settings to change the default currency symbols, formatting for display, and numeric precision.  <p><b>Controls:</b><br>Click the Update button to save your changes.

If your log file is accessible through a web browser, use HTTP.  If no password is required, simply leave the username and password fields blank.  FTP can be used with a username and password (usually the same as your username for uploading content to your site).  UNC, which is only available on Windows systems, will require a username and password in order to access the UNC share.<p><b>Server Name/IP</b><br>Enter the Server Name (e.g., www.urchin.com) or IP Address (e.g., 63.212.171.4) where the log file is located.  For UNC, use the \\server\share notation.<p><b>Same Local and Remote Login</b><br>This option is visible if UNC has been selected as the Server Protocol (Windows only). Select Yes if the same login and password can be used for both the local and remote server. Select No if the remote server requires a different login or password as the local server. Additional fields for the Local Server Login will become visible if you select No.<p><b>Server Port</b><br>The Server Port will be filled in automatically.  But if you are using a non-standard port, you can edit this manually.<p><b>Username/Password</b><br>These fields will be blank for non-authenticated HTTP and anonymous FTP connections.  To use an authenticated HTTP/FTP connection, enter your username and password here.  UNC requires a username and password to access the share. <p><b>Domain (UNC only)</b><br>If the UNC share is part of a Domain, then enter the Domain network information here. <p><b>FTP Mode</b><br>This option is visible when FTP has been selected as the Server Protocol. Select Passive for passive (PASV) transfer method. Select Active for direct (PORT) transfer method. <p><b>Remote Log Source File</b><br>The Remote Log Source File specifies the path to the log file on the remote system.  If you are using HTTP, it is often easier if you locate the log file with a web browser first. To do this, enter the site‘s URL into a browser followed by a slash, any directories’ names that are used, and the log file‘s name (e.g., http://www.urchin.com/logs/access_log). If the browser screen fills up with text, you‘ve got the right path. Just enter everything to the right of the domain (e.g., /logs/access_log). Note that wildcards are not supported for remote HTTP-based log source pathnames. If you are using FTP, you can browse the remote server to find the log file.  Before browsing you will need to configure the server / username information.<p><b>Log Destination</b> (Remote Only)<br>Before processing, remote log files are transferred to the local system.  Select a local directory for storing the log file.  A browse button is provided.<p><b>Proxy Server</b> (HTTP and HTTPS only)<br>If the log is available via a proxy machine, specify the IP address or hostname. <p><b>Proxy Port</b> (HTTP and HTTPS only)<br>If the log is available via a proxy machine, specify the port.<p><b>Proxy Username</b> and <b>Proxy Password</b><br>If the log is available via a proxy machine that requires a username and password, specify them in these fields.

This selection is useful for logs that have already been compressed. <li>Select Delete to delete the log file after processing.</ul>  Note that both the Archive and Delete selections require the Urchin process to have the appropriate permissions. For Log Sources that are used by multiple profiles, only the Don‘t Touch option should be selected. <b>Warning:</b> Do not use Archive or Delete options with live log files!  <p><b>URI Stem to Lower Case</b><br> When enabled, this option will automatically force lower case in the URL for logs created on Windows platforms where the URL for the same file can be both uppercase and lowercase, and subsequently causes two different entries for this file to appear in the Content reports<p><b>Query Token</b><br>Dynamically-generated page URLs will generally use a Query Token to separate the base of the URL from the specific query information. Urchin needs to know what this is so that it can properly parse the URL for its reports. Usually the Query Token is a question mark.<p><b>Date/Time Wildcard Substitution in Log Path Name</b><br>In order to automate Urchin and have it open the proper log files, the log file path name may contain datestamp wildcards which can be based on the current time.  However, it is common for Urchin to run after the logfiles have been rotated and datestamped.  In order for Urchin to find the correct log file, it may need to know how to adjust the time when replacing date wildcards.  By default, Urchin will look for yesterday‘s log files (local - 24 hours).  Wildcarding follows the <i>strftime</i> convention which is described in the online documentation center. Range of Days indicates the number of days for Urchin to go back in time when matching a strftime-compliant string in the logfile name. This setting is very useful in environments where the current day‘s logfile may not be present and allows Urchin to do “catch-up” processing if the logfile is available at a future date within the Range of Days window.<p><b>Controls</b><br>Click the Update button to save your changes.

876	<b>Profiles: Goals</b><p>Edit a goal by clicking on the corresponding tab at the top of the screen. Then, click the <img alt='Analysis Options Button' title='magic wand' src ='/uicons/default/wizard.gif' border=''> at top right to activate the Goal Setting Wizard. Use the web browser embedded in the Wizard to navigate to a page that you would like to set as a funnel step or goal. To select the page as step 1, click <b>Set Page As Step: 1</b>. Repeat for each step in your funnel. Click <b>Set Page As Goal</b> to set the page as the goal and close the Wizard. The pages you have selected will appear in the Steps and Goal Web Address fields. Please note that it is not necessary to include the <i>http://www.domain.com</i> portion of the URL in the Goal Web Address or the Web Address field for any of the steps. Urchin will ignore this part of the URL.<p>IMPORTANT: Urchin allows regular expressions to be used in all the Web Address fields for the Steps and Goal. Be sure to escape all regular expression metacharacters after last forward slash (‘/’); i.e. character like ‘?’ or ’.’ in the Web Address should be escaped using backslash character (‘\’) if you wish for Urchin to interpret them literally.  <p><b>Goal Settings</b><br>Urchin will count each visit to the URL you specify in <b>Goal Web Address</b> as a goal conversion whenever <b>Activate Goal</b> is “on”. The name you provide in <b>Goal Name</b> will be displayed on Urchin reports. The value you provide in <b>Goal Value (Revenue)</b> will be used to calculate ROI and other valuation metrics.<p><b>Goal Funnel Settings</b><br>Specify the steps leading up to the goal in this section. Each step is a page on the path towards conversion to the goal. Together, the steps represent a conversion funnel. Urchin shows how many visitors complete each step and how many abandon your funnel at each step in the Content Optimization-->Goals & Funnel Process-->Defined Funnel Abandonment report. For each step, provide a URL and a name for the page. <p><b>Goal Advanced Settings</b><br>When reporting goal conversions and step completions, Urchin compares the URLs you provide with the URLs that are visited. When <b>Web Address Option</b> is set to “URL without Query”, Urchin ignores the query portion of the URLs in these comparisons. Setting <b>Case Sensitive</b> to “Yes” makes these comparisons case sensitive. Setting <b>Require Step 1</b> to “Yes” indicates that only paths to conversion that include the first step are to be included funnel reports.
